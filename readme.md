The CPU Scheduler Simulator helps visualize and compare CPU scheduling algorithms. Developed for CS 3502 - Operations Systems at Kennesaw State University.

Supported Scheduling Algorithms:
FCFS
SJF
Priority
Round Robin
(+) SRTF
(+) MLFQ

Performance metrics tracked are:
Average Waiting Time - the time processes spent waiting in the queue.
Average Turnaround Time - the total time from process arrival to completion
CPU Utilization - ratio of active CPU time
Thoughput - number of completes processes per unit of time.
Average Response Time - time until first CPU response

(+) Key Additions (+)
Added SRTF and MLFQ algorithms.
Added buttons for both algorithms.
Performance metrics section in results panel.

(?) Running Instructions (?)
1. Navigate to schedule and enter the desired number of processes. Click "Set Process Count"
2. Use "Generate Random" or "Load Example" from dropdown
3. Choose an algorithm (newly implemented algorithms are colored buttons)
4. View results
